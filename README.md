### March 31, 2016

This is a repository of materials that will be used during the PCL workshop "Introduction to R." These materials should be downloaded as a zip file and opened in a folder. All materials will be available for the foreseeable future, so feel free to note this address and return to get the examples for yourself at a later date. 

If there are any questions or comments about the workshop, or you would like any R advice in the future, please don't hesitate to contact me via twitter: @foxandtheflu, or email: spncrfx@gmail.com.
